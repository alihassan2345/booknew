# Week 4: AI-Robot Brain

This week focuses on the intelligence layer of robotics, covering perception, planning, and control.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand perception systems for robotics
- Learn about VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Explore Nav2 for navigation and path planning
- Generate synthetic data for AI training

## Content

Building on simulation from Week 3, we now add the AI brain layer:

- Perception systems and computer vision for robots
- VSLAM for spatial understanding
- Navigation and path planning with Nav2
- Synthetic data generation for training
- Integration with Isaac Sim

## Activities

- Implement basic perception algorithms
- Set up VSLAM for your simulated robot
- Configure Nav2 for navigation tasks
- Generate synthetic data for model training
