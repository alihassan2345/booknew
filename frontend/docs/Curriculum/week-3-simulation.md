# Week 3: Simulation and Digital Twins

This week focuses on creating and working with digital twins for robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand digital twin concepts and their importance in robotics
- Learn to use Gazebo for physics simulation
- Explore NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced robotics simulation
- Understand sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)

## Content

Continuing from ROS fundamentals, we explore how to create realistic simulations:

- Physics engines and simulation environments
- Setting up Gazebo with your robot models
- Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Sensor simulation and data generation
- Bridging simulation and real-world robotics

## Activities

- Install and set up Gazebo
- Simulate your URDF robot from Week 2
- Explore Isaac Sim capabilities
- Generate synthetic data from simulation
