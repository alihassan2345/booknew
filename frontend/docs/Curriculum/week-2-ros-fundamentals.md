# Week 2: ROS Fundamentals

This week focuses on understanding the Robot Operating System (ROS) as the nervous system for robots.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand ROS architecture and concepts
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and parameters
- Practice with `rclpy` and basic ROS programming
- Explore URDF for humanoid robot modeling

## Content

Building on the introduction from Week 1, we dive into the robotic nervous system:

- ROS 2 architecture overview
- Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- Working with `rclpy` for Python-based robotics
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Introduction to TF (Transforms) system

## Activities

- Set up ROS 2 environment
- Create your first ROS 2 nodes
- Experiment with topics and services
- Build a simple URDF model
