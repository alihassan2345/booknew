# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence. This book covers the fundamental concepts of bridging the digital-physical gap in robotics applications.

## Overview

This book is structured into four core modules that will take you from basic concepts to advanced implementations:

1. **Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System**: Learn about ROS 2 architecture, Nodes, Topics, Services, and URDF for humanoids.
2. **Module 2 - The Digital Twin**: Explore physics engines, Gazebo/Unity setup, and sensor simulation.
3. **Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain**: Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Synthetic Data, VSLAM, and Nav2 path planning.
4. **Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action**: Implement Voice-to-Action with Whisper and Cognitive Planning using LLMs.

## Learning Path

Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a progressive learning path from basic to advanced concepts. Follow the curriculum section for a 13-week breakdown of practical exercises and hardware guidance.
